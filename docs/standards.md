# Conventions/standards

EUGENe is very much meant to be a community project. It represents a collection of data, models, and techniques meant for analyzing sequence data with deep learning. We are looking for contributions in almost every aspect of EUGENe.

Please do not hesitate to contact us if you have any questions or suggestions.

We will be posting a set of conventions and standards for understanding and **contributing** to EUGENe soon. Stay tuned!
