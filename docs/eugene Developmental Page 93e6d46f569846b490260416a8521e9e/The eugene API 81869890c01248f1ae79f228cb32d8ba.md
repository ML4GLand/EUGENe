# The eugene API

# The`eugene` API

- Need to brainstorm a better way to include different modules
    - I feel like an interpet module should be inherent in the eugene framework
        - A model should have a property that includes explanations or something
    - I also feel like it should save to something like an hdf5 so all the info is there

## `EUGENE.py`

- CLI interpret and API
    - `feature_importances`
    -
