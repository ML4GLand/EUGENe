# eugene Developmental Page

My current process for development of `eugene` is to implement functionality in either [VSCode](https://www.notion.so/VSCode-4e6186028a1248afb8c223b02ccbdc4f)  or [JupyterLab](https://www.notion.so/JupyterLab-f43de669114647988483cdece70b2722) (I want to look into Juptyter testbooks and into doing more unit testing in VSCode). Once I am satisfied with the implementation it needs to be rigorously tested (and seldom is) in either a `XX_test_EUGENE_*.ipynb` notebook or through unit tests. Finally it should be integrated into the `eugene` codebase.

I want to eventually create a stable “release” of `eugene` with the core functionality mentioned above. Then development will proceed by pull requests.
