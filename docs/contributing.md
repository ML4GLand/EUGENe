As we work towards a stable v1.0.0 release, and we typically develop on branches. These are merged into `dev` once sufficiently tested. `dev` is the latest, stable, development branch. 

`main` is used only for official releases and is considered to be stable. If you submit a pull request, please make sure to request to merge into `dev` and NOT `main`.
