# ‚ùìWhat is `eugene`?

EUGENE (**E**lucidating and **U**nderstanding **G**rammar of **E**nhancers with **Ne**uralnets) is a computational framework for building models that make predictions using primarily DNA sequence as input. EUGENE is primarily designed for predicting tissue-specific enhancer activity from massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) libraries, but is general enough to be applied to a variety of sequence-based prediction tasks. It consists of a codebase for building, training, validating and interpreting several deep learning architectures. Some notes on the scope of **EUGENE:**

- **For starters, the models will only DNA input will be considered. But it is worth noting that extensions to other sequence based inputs are not out of the question**
- **Most of the tasks performed by this framework will be supervised (i.e., labels are necessary), though we are looking to extend into some more unsupervised, semi-supervised and probabilistic modeling techniques**

# Installation

---

[seqtools-py37](https://www.notion.so/seqtools-py37-9fb9e31c952e4b3d86a14bd324cabd66) and [eugene_benchmarks](https://www.notion.so/eugene_benchmarks-a6da09e2b46a4eb89d6e9ea710608510) 

```bash
pip install -e eugene
```

Need a base set of packages necessary to get this up and running (eventually)

- `pytorch_lightning`(with CLI add-ons*)
- `pytorch`
- `seqlogo`
- 

# Core Functionality

---

1. Build a LightningModule
2. Train a LightningModule from the command line or through the API
3. Validate the model on unseen test data
4. Interpret the model through a suite of tools
