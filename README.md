# **E**lucidating the **U**tility of **G**enomic **E**lements with **Ne**ural Nets

EUGENe is a Python toolkit for building and evaluating sequence-based deep learning models in genomics. It provides a unified workflow for managing data, training models, and interpreting predictions on biological sequences.

You can find the [current documentation](https://eugene-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) here for getting started.
