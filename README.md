# EUGENE (**E**lucidating and **U**nderstanding **G**rammar of **E**lements with **Ne**uralnets)

EUGENe represents a computational framework for modeling regulatory sequences as input. It is designed after the Scanpy framework for single cell analysis in Python and is meant to make the development of deep learning worfklos in the genomics field more findable, accessible, interoperitable and reproducible. EUGENe consists of several modules for building, training, evaluating and interpreting deep learners that model sequence-based data. EUGENe is primarily designed to be used through its Python API and we feel that users will get the most out of it by using a notebook interface (i.e. Jupyter).

EUGENe is a package that is still active development, so you will likely run into errors and small typos if you choose to use EUGENe before its first stable release. If you run into such errors or have any questions, please open an issue! You can read the current documentation here.
