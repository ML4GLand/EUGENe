This directory contains notebooks that show the basic training procedure using SeqData and EUGENe modules. In each, we make use of the built-in 1000 random sequence dataset to showcase how to set up training for a variety of tasks, inlcuding:

1. Single task regression (`single_task_regression.ipynb`)
2. Multitask regression (`multitask_regression.ipynb`)
3. Binary classification (`binary_classification.ipynb`)
4. Multiclass classification (`multiclass_classification.ipynb`)
5. Multilabel classification (`multilabel_classification.ipynb`)
