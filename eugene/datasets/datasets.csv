ols,1153,TBD,This library allows for potential quantitative (what level of activation does a particular sequence confer, harder) and categorical (is a particular sequence and enhancer, easier) modeling of enhancer activity. Would still be on the lookout for ways to qualitatively model (what tissues is an element an enhancer, hardest).
Khouiery10,1022,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096098221000432X?via%3Dihub#mmc2,This data comes from genomic sequences of Ciona intestinalis and Ciona savignyi that were tested in a 2010 CellPress paper by Khoueiry et al. Briefly, these sequences were identified by scanning the genomes for clusters of two ETS and two GATA sites using a phylogenetic footprinting-based algorithm named Search for Evolutionary COnserved MODules (SECOMOD). The algorithm searches for clusters of binding sites in Ciona intestinalis according to a number of sites and a cluster size specified by the user. It then identifies the orthologous region in Ciona savignyi and checks whether this region also contains the required number of sites and has the correct size. The authors scanned for GATA (GATA) and MGGAAR (ETS) in 80bp to start to find 9 clusters, but then expanded the search window to 130bp and relaxed the ETS constraint to HGGAWR, which led to 46 additional clusters. They also had an intersite distance threshold of 5bp and an overall sequence conservation threshold of 40%.
