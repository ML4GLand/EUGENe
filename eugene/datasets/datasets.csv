farley15,163708,https://zenodo.org/record/6863861#.YuG15uxKg-Q,This dataset represents SEL-seq data generated by first constructing a dictionary of unique barcode tag-enhancer pairs by allowing 2 bp mismatches in the ~69 bp enhancers to buffer the sequencing mistakes. If more than one barcode tag was associated with a single enhancer the maximum reads between these tags were used. Barcoded tags that were attached to multiple enhancers were removed. The resulting dictionary contains 2534802 enhancers that are uniquely mapped to one or more barcode tags. 2 biological replicates were used in this experiment and the reads per million total reads (RPM) was used for each tag. In total 163708 enhancers were detected by RNA-seq and 21799 of them were defined as active enhancers by RPM ≥ 4 in either of the 2 replicates.
