Comes with EUGENe installation.,Adam Klie (aklie@eng.ucsd.edu)
ray13,241357,244,"probe set (Probe_Set), bidning intensity values for RBPs (RNCMPT*)",http://hugheslab.ccbr.utoronto.ca/supplementary-data/RNAcompete_eukarya/,"This dataset represents an in vitro RNA binding protein (RBP) assay of 244 RBPs. The dataset is downloaded as a single TSV file with RNA probes as rows and RBPs as columns. Each entry in the table is an intensity measurement (can be normalized or raw) of the binding of each protein to each probe. There are over 244 RBP columns and 241,357 sequences spanning two probe sets (SetA and SetB).",Hayden Stites (haydencooperstites@gmail.com)
farley15,163708,2,"barcode (Barcode), RPMs from each biological replicate (Biological Replicate 1 (RPM), Biological Replicate 2 (RPM))",https://zenodo.org/record/6863861#.YuG15uxKg-Q,"This dataset represents SEL-seq data of C. intestinalis Otx-a enhancer variants. 2 biological replicates were used in this experiment and the reads per million total reads (RPM) was used to define expression of each barcode tag of an enhancer variant. In total 163.708 enhancers were detected by RNA-seq (and included in this dataset) and 21,799 of them were defined as active enhancers by an RPM ≥ 4 in either of the 2 replicates.",Adam Klie (aklie@eng.ucsd.edu)
deBoer20,100000000+,1,Variable depending on chosen file,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE104878,Gigantic parallel reporter assay data from ~100 million synthetic promoters (in yeast) comprised of random DNA. Each sequence had its expression measured by FACS (sorting into 18 bins). This dataset is split amongst 8 downloadable files with different sequences in each. See the associated paper and GEO accession for more information.,Adam Klie (aklie@eng.ucsd.edu)
jores21,147966,1,"set (set), species (sp), gene promoter came from (gene), activity score (enrichment)",https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tobjores/Synthetic-Promoter-Designs-Enabled-by-a-Comprehensive-Analysis-of-Plant-Core-Promoters/main/CNN,"This datast includes activity scores for 79,838 plant promoters tested in both tobacco leaves and maize protoplasts. The real valued enrichment scores included with this dataset were calculated using barcode median ratios and by normalizing by control constructs. The promoters originated from 3 different plant species were tested. There are 72,158 sequences with activity scores for the tobacco leaves and 75,808 sequences with activity scores for the maize protoplasts.",Adam Klie (aklie@eng.ucsd.edu)

In total, 11,658 developmental and 7,062 housekeeping enhancers were assayed with both a housekeeping and a developmental promoter. This dataset consists of 402,296 traiing sequences, 40,570 validation squences, 41,186 test sequences.",Adam Klie (aklie@eng.ucsd.edu)
