# This directory contains the data used to train active enhancer models (EUGENE models). It has already been preprocessed (either downloaded from paper or processed by Joe) so it lives in this folder (as opposed to simlinked to a shared or raw data directory). ALl files other than those described here have been generated after downloading.

3.ForAdam.EnhancerTable.FunctionalEnhancers.WT-detected.ABL-notDetected.10R-20U-0.1P.tsv
Data recieved from Joe after preprocessing and filtering the sequencing data. From what I currently understand, this is just enhancer and a binary label of 1 (active) or 0 (not active)

1. NAME - Site list
2. SEQUENCE - Sequence
3. MPRA_FXN - Functional by MPRA (see slide 2)
    - Activity >.4 = functional (1)
    - Activity <.18 = non-functional (0)
    - If activity is in between => ‘na’
4. MICROSCPOPE_FXN - Microscope functional group
    - Only be for experiments with low variance and good controls (lacking *)
5. ACTIVITY_SUMRNA_NUMDNA
    - Activity score => sum MRPM all RNA barcodes / number DNA barcodes
